I was born in the <span class="underline">Basque country</span> in Spain (as you probably guessed by reading y name), and came to Austria in 2013. I had just finished my Graphic Design studies in San Sebastian, and was all worked up about working in advertising being creative and all and I've ever since been working at Ad Agencies</p>
    <p>It's been a while now, and last year I made a step on what I think is the right direction. I learned <span class="underline">Frontend Web Development</span>. I thought I needed to jump the gap from classic graphic design and get myself into the new Digital Era, still be creative while moving with the times. While learning to code I realized I was spending 90% of the time I needed to finish my assignments, polishing every detail on the interfaces in order to make it all pretty and user friendly.</p>
    <p>This is when I thought I needed to finish the leap and put a foot on the <span class="underline">Frontend</span> world.`,
